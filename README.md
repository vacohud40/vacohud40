### Hi there! I'm **Edris Alrubeydi** üëã

Jr Data Scientist! Bringing 21 years of banking experience to the world of data. [cite_start]Away from the keyboard, I'm a father of two who loves to travel and play chess. [cite: 27]

[cite_start]I am a data science bootcamp graduate with over two decades of experience in quantitative analysis within wealth management lending. [cite: 3] [cite_start]I am proficient in machine learning, statistical modeling, and data visualization, demonstrated through developing predictive solutions and extracting actionable insights from complex datasets. [cite: 3] [cite_start]My unique blend of financial acumen and technical data science skills positions me for impactful contributions to data-driven decision-making and business growth. [cite: 4]
